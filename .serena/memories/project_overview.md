# Demeter AI 2.0 — Project Overview

## Purpose
Multi-tenant stock control and analytics platform for same-industry SaaS businesses.

data, catalogs, workflows, and configurations completely isolated per tenant.

## Target Industries

any industry where multiple companies manage physical stock.

Each tenant (business) gets its own universe of products, warehouses, pricing, analytics,
and custom metadata — without needing a separate deployment.
